Voice-Controlled Car Project

A microcontroller-based project to control a car using voice commands via Bluetooth. The car can move forward, backward, turn left, or right, and stop based on commands like "forward", "backward", "left", "right", and "stop". It also includes obstacle detection with an ultrasonic sensor.

Features:
- Voice Control: Commands sent via a Bluetooth HC-05 module from a smartphone.
- Obstacle Avoidance: Ultrasonic sensor detects objects and stops the car.
- Flexible Movement: Responds to commands to move forward, backward, left, or right.
- Immediate Stop: Stops the car upon receiving the "stop" command.

Components:
- Arduino Uno/Nano
- L298N Motor Driver Module
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- DC Motors and Wheels
- Power Supply (Battery)
- Chassis for the car
